# BloodDonationSystemDB
Microsoft Sql blood donation system db

I have designed a database using Microsoft SQL Server to manage any blood donation system and ensure its more efficient utilization. In my database, I have utilized various technologies
such as queries, views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers. I have explained the database step by step using an ER diagram and normalization.
